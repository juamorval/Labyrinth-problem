# Maze Problem

The task consists of creating a program capable of finding the most efficient path to escape from a maze while avoiding any obstacles that may be in its way. The allowed movements are 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', and the mobile cell that should find the exit occupies only one square. 
The problem must be solved using the following algorithms: 
* Breadth-First Search Algorithm (BFS)
* Depth-First Search Algorithm (DFS)
* Greedy Search Algorithm
* Random Search Algorithm
* A star Algorithm
